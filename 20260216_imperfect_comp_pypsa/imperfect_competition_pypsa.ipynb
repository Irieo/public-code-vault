    "This example demonstrates how to model oligopolistic behaviour in energy markets using PyPSA. The notebook provides some theoretical background and a quick neat PyPSA implementation.\n",

Instead, we use a trick known as the \"fictitious objective\" in the economics/OR literature, perhaps underappreciated in energy system modelling stream.\n",

    "## Background: why bother?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of plentiful examples of oligopolistic markets in energy context, where handful of large producers can exercise market power and drive up prices: natural gas supply, gas turbines manufacturing, material supply chains, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard approach to modelling imperfect competition games is via KKT conditions, formulating Mixed Complementarity Problems (MCPs) and solving them with specialised solvers (mainly PATH). \n",
    "An amazing resource for learning about this is [Complementarity Modeling in Energy Markets\n",
    "](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-6123-5) by Steven Gabriel and co-authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP feature complementarity constraints that yield non-convexities, but a Big-M method can make them tractable for MIP solvers. Thus we can implement imperfect competition models with complementarity constraints in linopy, for example [this quick linopy example](https://iriepin.com/uploads/imperfect-games-linopy.py) covers perfect competition, Cournot-Nash oligopoly, asymmetric information, Stackelberg, and conjectural variations games solved as mixed-integer linear problems based on KKT conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this approach is impractical for PyPSA implementation. PyPSA acts as an optimisation wrapper around a network (model) instance — it automatically builds a cost-minimisation problem (LP, MIP, or QP) from the user-defined components and their attributes. Casting an MCP would require automatic derivation of first-order conditions and mapping of dual variables for each component, which would be tricky (if possible at all?) to generalise across all of PyPSA's functionality. It turns out there is another route in the economics/OR literature from 1990s."

    "## The \"fictitious objective\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cournot equilibrium among $N$ players can be characterised as the solution to a **single optimisation problem**. Margaret Slade's [1994 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2950588) calls it a \"fictitious-objective function\" that reproduces equilibrium game results. The paper shows that for the homogeneous Cournot game, linear demand is sufficient for the existence of such a fictitious objective.\n",

    "Ben Hobbs also explored this topic in [2001 paper](https://hobbsgroup.johnshopkins.edu/docs/papers/IEEE_Hobbs_2001_LCP00918286.pdf) by comparing the standard KKT and LCP formulations. The paper concludes: \"The key assumption that permits their [KKT-based equilibrium] formulation as LCPs is that each producer naively assumes that its output will not affect transmission prices\" - so another condition for the existence of a fictitious objective is that there is no binding network constraints that create asymmetric shadow prices across strategic players.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, FOC becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_i} \\big[ P(Q) \\cdot q_i - C_i(q_i) \\big] = P(Q) + P'(Q) \\cdot q_i - C_i'(q_i) = 0$$\n",

For $0 < cv_i < 1$, the generator has **partial strategic awareness**. At $cv_i = 1$, we get the classic **Cournot-Nash** assumption — rivals hold output fixed.\n",

    "## A note on calibrating demand parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In energy system models, demand is often modelled as an inelastic load (in PyPSA: `Load` component with `p_set`). NB \n",
    "\n",
    "If demand is perfectly inelastic ($b \\to \\infty$, $Q = \\bar{Q}$ for all prices), the Cournot markup $b \\cdot cv_i \\cdot q_i \\to \\infty$. This is economically correct: without any demand response, a generator at margin can charge any price. NB this phenomenon is a reason for various modelling artifacts around price formation that is illustrated in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2025.108483).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fictitious objective approach to modelling imperfect competition relies on the markup term, which depends on the demand slope $b$. Recall that Slade's [1994 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2950588) proves the existence of a fictitious objective for linear demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, demand has some finite price elasticity $\\varepsilon < 0$. The point elasticity of linear demand at an observed operating point $(\\bar{Q}, \\bar{P})$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\varepsilon = -\\frac{1}{b} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar{P}}{\\bar{Q}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $b$ and $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b = \\frac{\\bar{P}}{\\bar{Q} \\cdot |\\varepsilon|} \\tag{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = \\bar{P} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{|\\varepsilon|}\\right) \\tag{6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are used as `marginal_cost = -a` and `marginal_cost_quadratic = b / 2` on an elastic demand generator (with `sign=-1`), replacing the fixed `Load`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example.** At $\\bar{P} = 50$ EUR/MWh, $\\bar{Q} = 5$ MW, $\\varepsilon = -0.1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b = \\frac{50}{5 \\times 0.1} = 100, \\qquad a = 50 \\times (1 + 10) = 550$$\n",
    "\n",
    "PS There are various functional forms for demand elasticity, which is also illustrated in the [Price formation without fuel costs (..)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2025.108483) paper."
